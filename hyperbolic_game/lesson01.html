  <!-- Title -->
  <h1>Lesson 1: Template code</h1>
  <br>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>The program that is described in this lesson will open an OpenGL
  window, and enter an infinite loop until the user either presses the
  escape key, or closes the window. Nothing is drawn in the window, so the
  window will only be black.

  <p>Since this is the first lesson, which outlines the skeleton of a
  <b>GLFW</b> program, the entire source code is listed here and described
  in detail. In subsequent lessons only the additions/changes to the
  template code that are essential to the topic at hand will be described
  in detail.

  First we need to include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;. This file defines the
  interface to the <b>GLFW</b> API, and it also automatically includes
  &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; and &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;, which are used by our program. We
  also include some other files that may be useful later.

  Next comes a function called Draw(). It will be called for every new
  frame that is to be rendered, and it is in this function that we place
  all our OpenGL rendering. For the moment, we will only put a few lines
  of code here, some of which are explained in more detail in following
  lessons.

  The first thing we do is the get the time for this frame. It will be
  used for frame-rate independent animations (our application may run
  at different frame-rates on different systems).

      // Get current time

  The second thing we do is to get the window dimensions, and set the
  OpenGL viewport to match the entire drawing area of the window. This is
  the first step in making our application resolution independent.
  </td></tr>

  <!-- Code -->
  <tr><td class=codecode><pre>
      // Get window size
      glfwGetWindowSize( &width, &height );

      // Make sure that height is non-zero to avoid division by zero
      height = height < 1 ? 1 : height;

      // Set viewport
      glViewport( 0, 0, width, height );</pre>

  Now we clear the color and depth buffers. We use a black color for
  clearing (red=green=blue=alpha=0), and tell OpenGL to clear both the
  color buffer and the depth buffer.
  </td></tr>

  <!-- Code -->
  <tr><td class=codecode><pre>
      // Clear color and depht buffers
      glClearColor( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f );
      glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );</pre>

  The last thing we do in this function, for this lesson, is to setup a
  "camera". You will learn more about how this works in the camera
  lessons, but I will give a brief explanation here (if it sounds
  strange or complicated, do not worry about these lines for the moment).

  <p>OpenGL has two geometry transformation matrices: the projection
  matrix and the modelview matrix. The projection matrix describes how 3D
  coordinates are translated to screen coordinates (it controls things
  like orthogonal or perspective views, wide or narrow angle perspectives
  etc). The modelview matrix describes rotation, translation and scaling
  of objects. In other words it is used to change the shape, orientation
  and position of individual objects, aswell as for positioning and aiming
  the &quot;camera&quot; (e.g. think of moving the camera in one direction
  as moving all the objects in the opposite direction instead).

  <p>Note that for the projection matrix we set an aspect that is
  controled by the window size, which is necessary for avoiding
  &quot;stretched&quot; objects if the window size changes.

  <tr><td class=codecode><pre>
      // Set up projection matrix

  Now we initialize <b>GLFW</b>, and open the OpenGL window. We request a
  window that has a drawing area of 640x480 pixels, and 24-bit color +
  8-bit alpha (32 bits per pixel). We also request a depth buffer that has
  a precision of 24 bits (note that we are not guaranteed to get the
  color and depth precision that we request - it really depends on the
  underlying hardware and some other stuff, but <b>GLFW</b> will do its
  best to find a good match).

  <p>We also request that we want a desktop window (<b>GLFW_WINDOW</b>),
  but we could request a fullscreen window instead
  (<b>GLFW_FULLSCREEN</b>), which can be useful for games for instance.
  For more information on how <b>glfwOpenWindow</b> works, please refer to
  the <b>GLFW Reference Manual</b>.

          8, 8, 8,           // Number of red, green, and blue bits for color buffer

  A few <b>GLFW</b> attributes are set. First, we set the window title to
  something representative (otherwise the window would be named 'GLFW
  Window'). Then we enable sticky keys, which ensures that we do not miss
  any keyboard presses (read the <b>GLFW</b> manuals for more information
  about sticky keys if you wonder what this is good for).

  <!-- Code -->
  <tr><td class=codecode><pre>

  Here comes the main loop. It constantly calls the Draw() function, and
  checks for program termination.

  <!-- Code -->

      // Main rendering loop
      do
      {
          // Call our rendering function
          Draw();

          // Swap front and back buffers (we use a double buffered display)
          glfwSwapBuffers();

          // Check if the escape key was pressed, or if the window was closed
          running = !glfwGetKey( GLFW_KEY_ESC ) &&
                    glfwGetWindowParam( GLFW_OPENED );
      }
      while( running );</pre>
  </td></tr>

  <!-- Text -->
  <tr><td class=codetext>
  When the main loop is no longer running, we shut down <b>GLFW</b> and
  exit the program.
  </td></tr>

  <!-- Code -->
  <tr><td class=codecode><pre>
      // Terminate GLFW
      glfwTerminate();

      // Exit program
      return 0;
  }</pre>
  </td></tr>

  </table>

  <p>The window that is opened by <b>GLFW</b> is a double buffered window
  (always), which means that two color buffers are used. One buffer is
  used for drawing to (the back buffer), while the other buffer is
  displayed on the screen (the front buffer). This means that an animation
  frame is not displayed until it is completely rendered (otherwise the
  display would have a lot of flickering &quot;garbage&quot;).

  <p><b>glfwSwapBuffers</b> is called from the main loop, which does two
  things:

  <ol>
    <li>Swap front and back buffers (i.e. display the newly rendered
    frame)</li>
    <li>Update all input state (poll for keyboard presses etc), and all
    window state (was the window size changed? was it minimized?)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In other words, <b>glfwSwapBuffers</b> marks the end of one frame,
  and the beginning of a new frame. At the same time it makes sure that
  our program recieves up to date information about user input and window
  events.
